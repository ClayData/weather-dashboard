This weather dashboard has a text entry form for a user to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast in whatever city is entered into it. When the search button is clicked the city that is input is used in 3 different ajax calls to the openweathermap Api (https://openweathermap.org/). Bootstrap and jQuery is used to create the html. Current weather is displayed in a jumbotron in the middle of the page. Below the jumbotron are 5 cards which show the weather for the 5 next days. On the left side of the webpage a list is generated with each city that is entered into the search bar. The list is saved in localstorage so that it remains even after leaving the page.
